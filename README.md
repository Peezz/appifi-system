# appifi-system
system installation for appifi and it's dependencies

### Caution
  1. Assume origin rootfs package just like tmp.tar.gz already exits under /home/ folder
  2. Assume kernel package just like kernel.deb already exits under /home/ folder
  3. Only need to run '**deploy-rootfs-outside-chroot.sh**', but you have to modify this file and '**deploy-rootfs-inside-chroot.sh**' if some names have changed like '*tmp.tar.gz*' or '*kernel.deb*'
